<p>1. If there's no options specified when the <b>map.locate</b> method is called, the map <u>will not recenter if geolocation is found</u> because the option for <b>setView</b> is <i>false</i>, so the map view will not adjust to the user's location.</p>

<p>2. a. The confidence level on the accuracy value returned by the API is <b>95%</b>.</p>
b. If the Geolocation API returned a heading reading of 135, the direction the device will be facing <b>southeast (SE)</b>.</p>

<p>3.
  <ul>Computer
    <li>Google Chrome</li>
    <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>Mobile
    <li>Google Chrome</li>
    <li>Apple Safari</li>
  </ul>

The main difference I saw from using the application on Chrome and Edge is that the geolocation accuracy seems to be more precise on Chrome <i>(within 98 feet)</i> compared to Edge <i>(within 699 feet)<i>.<p>
<p>A difference in user experience on using the application on mobile Chrome and Safari is that I had to go through <b>two pop-up screens</b> on Chrome compared to <b>three pop-up screens</b> on Safari allow geolocation of my device.<p>
<p>The only I ran into while testing was on mobile Safari because all the icons for the icons were in dark mode since it follows the native application theme that is applied to almost all stock apps on my iPhone.<p>
